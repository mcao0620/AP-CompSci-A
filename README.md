# AP Computer Science A

These are a few projects that I worked on during the AP Computer Science A course during high school. 

## Minesweeper

I designed a full, working version of Minesweeper using Java and Processing3. This version of Minesweeper includes features such as flags, hover effects, a timer/score tracking, and visual effects. 

## Fractals

This is a collection of fractals designed using Java and Processing3 that implement recursion.
